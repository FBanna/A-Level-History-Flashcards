        - Second coalition weakened by Russian withdrawal at Zurich- Sept 1799
        - Fought 60 battles, only lost 7

        = Napoleon and Italy by 1808
        - Feb 1808 - Ordered occupation of Rome
        - March 1808 - Annexed Papal States (Ancona, Fermo, Urbino, Macerata) to Kingdom of Italy (puppet state)
        - Caused break-down of Papal relations as Napoleon (partly) asserted his dominance over the church
        - Helped consolidate his continental system
        - 1809 - Annexed last Papal States to France
          - Resulted in excommunication of Napoleon even though he received 2 mil franc pension per year
          - Pope moved repeatedly before being confined at Savona till 1814

        = Weakness of enemies

        - used outdated tactics:
          - forced conscription
          - large, slow armies -> predictable
        - Slowly began to pick up new tactics but were crushed at beginning of wars
        - Never united, fighting for different reasons on different fronts eg. Russia an Austria during Battle of Austria and Russia. separated and defeated

        = Strengths - Grand Armee

        - Increased skill due to promotion by merit and military training in lycees
        - Modern weapons eg. lighter artillery
        - Recruitment
          - 1793 onwards relied on conscription(large French pop.)
          - Used men from the empire
          - Used propaganda to recruit more men + rally them
          - Veterans worked along side new recruits. More moral
        - Corps
          - used after 1800 reorganisation of army
          - Used smaller groups of troops who were more manoeuvrable
          - converged onto battle
          - lived off the land, so easier to move

        = Strengths - Leadership

        - Napoleon was a military genius, using tactics
          - feign losses before surprise attacks
          - took enemies out one by one
        - Could effectively use the entire might of the empire
        - Flexible to many situations
        - Personal leader, spoke and rewarded troops. More loyalty even during Russian campaign
