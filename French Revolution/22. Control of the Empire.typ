        = Economy - "France First" - Mixed results

        - destroyed pre-existing systems (guilds, privilege, taxs)
        - increased efficiency to increase economic output:
          - tax revenue from Kingdom of Italy +50%
          - tax simplified - Naples 100 taxes to 1 (land + industry)
          - Holland - land tax, high tax on farms = less on rich
        - Used "dotations", gave church land to supporters, they could not sell it without permission + had to swear oath
          - Poland & Westphalia gave 25% of all dotations
          - Duchy of Warsaw lost 1/5 of revenue due to land loss
        - Satellite states seen as suppliers of resources. Worsened after the Continental system (Berlin Decree - 1806 & Milan Decree - 1807) to help Fr industry - lost markets
          - North Italy's silk suffered, had to export to France
        - Meanwhile inner empire enjoyed preferential treatment
          - Belgium's textiles did very well
          - Confederation of the rhine helped mining there
          - Locals outcompeted - Grand Duchy of Berg's textiles
        - Napoleon focussed on large Agricultural policies:
          - resulted in large gap between small & large farm
          - Italian rice sent to Fr, did *finally* create unified market
